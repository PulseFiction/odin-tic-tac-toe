# odin-tic-tac-toe

## Description

A project as part of the Odin Project Full Stack Javascript Course. Task was to create a tic-tac-toe game with the focus of using factory functions and modules(IIFE).

Currently only operates with one player entering their name and if they want to play with another they can take turns clicking
on each cell. 
May include a minimax AI once I get more proficient.
